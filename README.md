# ADS-B Virtual Radar #

Make Homey into an aircraft radar based on ADS-B tracker info from virtualradarserver.co.uk.

* Ever wanted to know where that plane over your house is heading?
* Do you want to track the local Police Helicopter?
* Do you need a record of small planes flying over your estate too low?
* Interested in knowing where Military airplanes are?
* Do you want to track your pilot husband all over the world?
* Do you want a push message when your wife is taking the helicopter again?
