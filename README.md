# ADS-B Virtual Radar #

Turn Homey into an aircraft radar or tracker. The radar information is based on
ADS-B tracker info from adsbexchange.com

* Ever wanted to know where that plane over your house is heading?
* Do you want to track the local Police Helicopter?
* Do you need a record of small planes flying over your estate too low?
* Interested in knowing where Military airplanes are?
* Do you want to track your pilot husband all over the world?
* Do you want a push message when your wife is taking the helicopter again?

### Radar: Live data from aircrafts in radar range ###
For each radar you can see the number of aircraft in reach, and information from
the nearest aircraft:

For each tracker you can see the location, direction, altitude, speed,
destination airport and track time:
